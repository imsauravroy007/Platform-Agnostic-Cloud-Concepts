This is a thought leadership topic explaining about cloud agnostic concepts which once you have should be a good starting point for working on any cloud platform (AWS,Azure,GCP). Here the idea is not to point you to any tutorial link to a particular cloud provider service rather direct you to cloud agnostic concepts. Its available as a public git repo and anybody can improvise or should feel free to add on.
